**Ideas and Innovation**
Welcome to the Ideas and Innovation project! This project, built using the Django framework, provides a platform for users to share and explore innovative ideas.

**Project Structure**
The project comprises two main components:

**ideaproj**: This directory contains the project settings, including settings.py and wsgi.py, as well as other configuration files for the Django project.
**ideasapp**: Inside this directory, you'll find the core functionality of the application. This includes models.py for defining database models, views.py for handling HTTP requests and responses, and other necessary files for implementing the business logic of the application.
Templates
The templates directory houses the HTML templates used to render the user interface of the application. Currently, it contains index.html for the main landing page and feedback.html for submitting feedback and ideas.

**Features**
Users can submit their ideas through the platform.
The application provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and exploring ideas.
A custom library is integrated to count the number of ideas displayed on the index page.
